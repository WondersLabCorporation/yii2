# Changes and additions
_____________________

* **AccessRule** - class override to include simple role-based access to actions
* **.htaccess** - mod_rewrite rules to send all /backend requests to backend application,
  /slicing requests to slicing folder and / requests to frontend application
* **ActiveRecord** - class override to include status constants active/deleted and methods for human-readable titles
* **ActiveRecordQuery** - ActiveQuery for ActiveRecord class with active() method and overrode findAll(...) to include condition
* **User** - model override to include Admin/User roles. 
Console and Backend User models added to allow both roles. Frontend User model allows User role only
* **configs** - index files re-writed in a way to include dev.php config files as the last stage. 
At the same time those files are in gitignore so any local configs can be placed there. common/config/sample.dev.php file added
